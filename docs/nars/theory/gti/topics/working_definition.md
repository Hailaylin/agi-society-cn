# Working Definition

[英文原文↗](https://cis.temple.edu/~pwang/GTI-book/GTI-TOPICS/GTI-WorkingDefinition.html)

Roughly speaking, in a book like this, there are two types of "definition". A relatively simple type of definition is used to specify the meaning a new word or phrase, by describing it with familiar words and phrases. A much more complicated type, some times called "working definition", is used to specify the meaning a word or phrase which is already familiar to the readers.

Working definition is needed when a word will be used with a specific meaning, which may either be one of several common usages of the word, or be different from all of them. An author introduces a working definition to clarify the meaning of the word in his writing, so as to avoid misunderstandings, as well as to indicate what he thinks what it _should_ mean, despite of the current common usage.

A classic treatment to this topic was given by Rudolf Carnap. In Carnap (1950), he explained what he think the word "probability" should mean. Beside proposing a definition, he also discussed the "meta-problem" of "transformation of an inexact, prescientific concept, the _explicandum_, into a new exact concept, the _explicatum_." He proposed four requirements: _similarity, exactness, fruitfulness_, and _simplicity_, with the following explanation:

> If a concept is given as explicandum, the task consists in finding another concept as its explicatum which fulfills the following requirements to a sufficient degree.
>
> 1. The explicatum is to be similar to the explicandum in such a way that, in most cases in which the explicandum has so far been used, the explicatum can be used; however, close similarity is not required, and considerable differences are permitted.
>
> 2. The characterization of the explicatum, that is, the rules of its use (for instance, in the form of a definition), is to be given in an exact form, so as to introduce the explicatum into a well-connected system of scientific concepts.
>
> 3. The explicatum is to be a fruitful concept, that is, useful for the formulation of many universal statements (empirical laws in the case of a nonlogical concept, logical theorems in the case of a logical concept).
>
> 4. The explicatum should be as simple as possible; this means as simple as the more important requirements (1), (2), and (3) permits.

I have been following the same requirements when given working definitions. Obviously, very often a compromise is needed when the requirements conflict. For example, words in natural language usually hard to define, so a relatively more exact and simple definition is often less similar to the original word. On the other hand, to use a word in a theory in the same way as it is used in everyday life would make the theory too uncertain to be fruitful. Therefore, to stress one requirement too much is not a good idea.
